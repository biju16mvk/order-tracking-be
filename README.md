This is a small application written in Node.JS for providing data to a FE application for tracking orders. 

## To run this app run the following commands after cloning/download the repository

#### `Make sure you have Node JS installed in your system`

### `cd order-tracking-be`
### `npm install`
### `npm run dev`

This will spin up a backend sever that runs in port 6060. You can change this port to the one you want, but make sure to uodate the same in the FE application.
